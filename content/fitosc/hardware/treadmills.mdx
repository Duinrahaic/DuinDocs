This is a community-maintained list of known compatible treadmills with FitOSC. While not exhaustive, this list provides detailed information about what each treadmill can do based on community research and testing. Good indicators of compatibility include the vendor apps the treadmill supports, as well as certain treadmill series from established vendors. Use the filters below to find treadmills that match your specific needs. For questions or contirbutions refer to the discord.

## Good Indicators To Watch For

Treadmills that communicate over BLE often have the below icons. This is a good indicator that there is a high chance of compatability:
