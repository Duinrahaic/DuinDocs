<Callout>
  If you see a "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen" popup, this is due to the app not being officially signed by Microsoft. You can click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to run the app.

  To quote Microsoft's own [FAQ about SmartScreen](https://fb.smartscreen.microsoft.com/smartscreenfaq.aspx):

  > Does this warning mean the file is malicious and will harm my computer?
  >
  > No - the App Reputation warning is not an indication that the download is malicious. However, for the average Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Windows user, this warning is usually associated with a download that may have a higher risk of being malicious.
